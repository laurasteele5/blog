<p>Tonight was the first night of class. I am not exactly 100% sure what to expect yet, but I believe that I am going to learn a lot! I think that it is going to take a lot of hardwork and patience on my part in order to become the best front-end developer/designer that I can be. I am willing and ready to learn, and can't wait to see what is to come!</p>

<p>I made it through my second class! Tonight we started writing our own HTML, and it was pretty exciting. The hardest part was setting up and pushing to GitHub. But, once I figured out the pattern I felt much more confident. I am really looking forward to creating my first website this weekend!
