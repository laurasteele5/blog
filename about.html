<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I have two beautiful daughters! Eden is 8, and Eve will be 2 in August. I am originally from Southeast Texas, but have been in the Austin area for a year and I love it!</p>
<p>Before beginning this course, I was a third grade teacher in Coupland, Texas. I love teaching, but I am ready for a career change! Being a teacher I have a love for learning, and this career field is ever-changing allowing me to be a forever learner.</p>
